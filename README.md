# My-History-data-APP
I have designed an APP called : My history data
the data that is collected is that of Heroes in the timeline of our word history- individual who have played great roles in our lives.
namely-Nkosi Johnson,steve Biko,martin luther king,adolf hitler,diana princess of wales,albert einstein,nelson rolihlahla mansela,mother theresa,michael jackson and mahatma gandhi.
the data includes the spesic age in which these icon passed away.

with all this data collected we come to the main purpose of the APP ,which is to compare an indivividual/student's age and see whether in our data there is an icon that passed away at that spesific age.
e.g Tom is 12 years old in our APP we enter 12 in our text name and click generate(button) to see results.

herin example age12=results "You are age 12,Nkosi J" +
                            "ohnson died at this age "
when no results or that spesific amount can be shown our APP will display "No historical known at this age"
the display of the APP ( USER INTERFACE) played a very important report in the design of this APP, hence its for students.
it therefore needs to serve good presentation engage with the student. the people using the APP should enjoy using the APP pleasure ( user experience) needs to be met
